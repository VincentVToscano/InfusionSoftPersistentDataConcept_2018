# InfusionSoftPersistentDataConcept_2018

Demonstrating the concept of using a combination of URL parameters and cookies to fill-in form input fields.

Note, this is a InfusionSoft order form that is being used locally and therefore contains no styling (except where
I put a blue background on the continue button). When the page loads, the window.onload function is called which performs
all of the checks (see notes by the window.onload function) for existing values. The continue button creates and updates
the cookies. In InfusionSoft, the continue button (Update Card) submits the form.
